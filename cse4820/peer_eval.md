### Drone Hacking
**Presenters' Name**: Alex Schmith, Robbert Heine

**The presentation and demo are done well**: 5

**The complexity of the project fits well to the timeline they had**: 5

**Any comment**: I wish that there was some more encryption with the drone's control, instead of just plain text through wifi-direct.

### RollJam Attack
**Presenters' Name**: Chandler Hake, Jared Blanco

**The presentation and demo are done well**: 5

**The complexity of the project fits well to the timeline they had**: 5 

**Any comment**: The description of the technical problem and solution to it was very succinct and easy to understand. Figuring out what they had to do to combat problems as they came up was interesting, as jamming the frequency incorporated noise when capturing.
